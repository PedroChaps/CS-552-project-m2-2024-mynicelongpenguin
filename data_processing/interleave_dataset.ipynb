       " 'answer': 'First, we need to choose the elements that will be in each subset. Since the subsets are ordered, we need to consider the order in which elements are chosen. We can do this by using a combination formula.\\n\\nTo divide the 8 elements into 5 subsets, we need to choose 4 dividers from the 7 spaces between the elements (since we need 5 subsets, and there are 8 elements). This can be done in 7 choose 4 ways, which is equal to 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35 ways.\\n\\nNext, we need to assign the elements to each subset. The first subset can have any number of elements from 1 to 4, the second subset can have any number of elements from 1 to 3, and so on. This can be done by considering the number of ways to partition the remaining elements after placing the dividers.\\n\\nThus, the total number of ways to divide the set of 8 elements into 5 non-empty ordered subsets is 35 * 4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 11760..Then, the correct answer is: 11760',\n",
